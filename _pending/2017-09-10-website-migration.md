# **Work In Progress!**

I really like GitHub pages as a a free and easy way for creating simple static websites; but the fact that SSL does not work with custom domain names is a deal breaker for me. However, all is not lost. Firebase is a free alternative that can host websites with custom domain names with SSL support. I used [this helpful blog post](https://chris.banes.me/2017/06/02/jekyll-firebase/) to get it set up. The website is still on GitHub, but my custom domain is now pointing to Firebase.
