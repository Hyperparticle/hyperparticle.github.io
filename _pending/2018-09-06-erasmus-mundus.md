If I told myself a year ago that I would be studying for my Master's in Europe, I would think I was crazy. I'm not typically one to go on adventures into the unknown, let alone a foreign country; but I have decided to try something different for a change.

Oh, how time flies: it's as lofty and distant as a kite, yet as quick as a bullet. My first semester at Charles University in Prague is now over, and so I would like to take a step back and share some of my experiences studying abroad in Europe, namely Prague. Here are some of the topics I will be covering:

1. The Erasmus Mundus Program
2. Transportation
3. Weather
4. Sights and Tours
5. Housing
6. Bureaucracy
7. Coursework
8. Final Remarks

## The Erasmus Mundus Program

I first heard of the Erasmus Mundus Master's program from a former alumnus, now a current professor at Boise State University. Basically, students in the program get the opportunity to study at two European partner universities, one year each, to obtain two Master's degrees at the end of it. I applied for the Language Communication Technologies (LCT) program in January 2017 and received an acceptance notice in April.

In addition, I received a scholarship which is essentially providing me a free education for my entire study period. I have more than enough funds for tuition, housing, living expenses, transportation, food, and basically anything else I need to live comfortably. It turns out living in Europe is cheap (aside from buying tech). Tuition, despite being double for overseas students (8,500 instead of 4,250), is completely covered. I'm grateful for this, as college expenses in the US is notoriously expensive, especially for Master's programs, which can reach as high as $40,000 for University costs alone. 

But many events have transpired since then.

Well, I've made it to the Czech Republic.

It took a couple days for the jet lag to wear off. A 7.5 hour flight is not a comfortable one.

On my third day in Prague I registered with the foreign police. The people I met with were highly unprofessional.

## Transportation in Prague

The transportation system around Prague is pretty great. The system of metro lines, trams, and busses ensure that you can get anywhere in the city in a short period of time. Tickets are quite cheap, and allow you to board any of the transportation in Prague. There's even a small boat that can take you from one side of the Vltava river to the other.

## Weather

Weather here is fairly calm and predictable. On most days, the sky will be overcast with clouds. Every few days it rains

I'm used to much drier, erratic weather back in Idaho. 

## Sights and Tours

Student discounts.

## Housing

Instead of going with the dorms, I've decided to stay at an apartment.

## Bureaucracy

Something tells me this process should have been easier, but it wasn't.

## Coursework

Most of the classes for the first semester were compulsory. Data Structures I, Introduction to Complexity and Computability, Statistical Natural Language Processing I, General Linguistics, Natural Language Processing Technologies. I took one elective, Speech Recognition.

Two classes in particular were immensely challenging: Data Structures I and Introduction to Complexity and Computability. They were taught by the same instructor. His favorite word was "trivial". In fact, I tallied up the results at the end of each class, and this instructor has said the word more than 214 times over the course of 14 weeks.

The instructor's grading style was highly unorthodox. If your results were not correct or your implementation had a bug in it, he would mark down your grade as a 0 and have you redo the assignment and resubmit with a 10% penalty.

At the start of the exam period, a group of students attended a meeting with the Vice Dean to discuss many of the issues we've been having in the class. Many expressed concerns that his grading style was unpredictable a .

Exams were even more intense. For Data Structures, I got two questions that amounted to two short sentences that amounted to, "Explain everything you know about this data structure." The resulting explanations took me 3 pages to fill from memory. No notes, just a pencil and paper and everything in your head. It was the hardest exam I've ever taken. All the other classes were a cakewalk in comparison. For the other classes, I studied maybe a day before in preparation, but for Data Structures and C&C, I had to spend two weeks of studying 4-5 hours each day to be comfortable to write out all the class material on a topic from memory.

Unfortunately, the items on the exam were questions that I understood the least.

One saving grace was that after the meeting, the exams were conducted with two instructors present, and they would both conduct the oral evaluation.

There's such a disparity in difficulty among first semester classes. On the one hand we're getting an introduction to Bash scripting, Python, text processing, and on the other hand we're proving the amortized complexity of a Fibonacci Heap using probability theory. The jump in difficulty is massive.

One thing that Charles University does that all other LCT-partnered universities do not is require a state exam at the conclusion of the Master's program. This means that after submitting my thesis, I will be required to go back to Prague to take a final exam on compulsory material that I have studied while at Charles University.

## Final Remarks

 I'm single, without a spouse or kids to take care of, young, and independent. At no other point in my life would I have an opportunity like this, to go and immerse myself in another country, expand my understanding of others' culture, and enjoy the food, sights, and activities Europe has to offer.

The topic, scholarship, and prospect of being immersed in a foreign culture were all motivating factors that led me here to this place at this point in time.

In the end, was it worth it? I think so. It has been such a challenge, but I've lived my life pursuing challenges. I have learned so much being independent in a foreign country.

"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."
