If I told myself a couple years ago that I would be studying for my Master's in Europe, I would think I was crazy. Raised in the quiet coniferous reaches of Idaho in the USA, I'm not typically one to go on adventures into the unknown, let alone a foreign country; but I have decided to try something different for a change. And that small step of courage has paid off more than I could imagine.

I have now completed a year of graduate studies at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, and am gearing up for a second year at Saarland University in Saarbrucken, Germany. No one seems to understand when I say I study computational linguistics, but I will get to that later.

The following post details my motivations for studying as a graduate student in Europe, as well as my first year experiences at Charles University. The list below indicates the topics I will cover.

## Summary

Oh, how time flies: the future is as lofty and distant as a kite, yet as quick as a bullet. My first semester at Charles University in Prague is now over, and so I would like to take a step back and share some of my experiences studying abroad in Europe, namely Prague. Here are some of the topics I will be covering:

1. The Erasmus Mundus Program
2. Transportation
3. Weather
4. Sights and Tours
5. Housing
6. Bureaucracy
7. Coursework
8. Final Remarks
