If I told myself a couple years ago that I would be studying for my Master's in Europe, I would think I was crazy. Raised in the quiet coniferous reaches of Idaho in the USA, I'm not typically one to go on adventures into the unknown, let alone a foreign country; but I have decided to try something different for a change. And that small step of courage has paid off more than I could imagine.

I have now completed a year of graduate studies at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, and am gearing up for a second year at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany. No one seems to understand when I say I study computational linguistics, but I will get to that later.

The following post details my motivations for studying as a graduate student in Europe, as well as my first year experiences at Charles University. The list below indicates the topics I will cover.

## Summary

I first learned of the [Erasmus Mundus](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-master-degrees_en) program from a good friend of mine, [Dr. Casey Kennington](https://coen.boisestate.edu/faculty-staff/caseykennington/), an assistant professor at Boise State University. He told me that he graduated with two Master's degrees from the program in [Language & Communication Technologies (LCT)](https://lct-master.org/), and shared with me all the cool places in Europe he got to visit. Prior to this, I had reservations, thinking that I would not be cut out for graduate studies. But the idea of exploring Europe, receiving two graduate degrees in two years, and potentially having it all paid for by a scholarship (tuition, travel, living expenses) from the European Commission was too enticing to pass up.

So I joined the Erasmus Mundus European Master's Program in Language & Communication Technologies, and have recently completed 2 of the program's 4 semesters at Charles University in Prague. Getting situated in the Czech Republic was not easy. There was a lot of red tape to get through, and the necessary bureaucratic paperwork was slow and cumbersome. But eventually, the paper shuffling ceased. Then I started to explore the beautiful romanesque and gothic architecture in the city. The narrow streets gradual hills painted a picture of a serene set piece lost in time&mdash;a calming attribute to an otherwise busy city. Transportation was efficient. I could take a metro and a couple tram rides and be across the entire city in half an hour. Shops, museums, cathedrals, and theaters were abundant. My studies preoccupied my attention most of the time, but it was fantastic knowing I could step outside and find immediate refreshment.

Coursework.

Projects.

Exploring.

How time flies: the future is as lofty and distant as a kite, yet as quick as a bullet. Now that my year is up, I'm ready for round two at Saarland University in Germany. More adventure awaits.
