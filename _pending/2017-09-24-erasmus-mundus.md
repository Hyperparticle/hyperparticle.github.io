  Life as an Erasmus Student: Week 1
---

Well, I've made it to the Czech Republic. Something tells me this process should have been easier, but it wasn't.

It took a couple days for the jet lag to wear off. A 7.5 hour flight is not a comfortable one.

Instead of going with the dorms, I've decided to stay at an apartment.

On my third day in Prague I registered with the foreign police.

I missed out on most of the activities for orientation week, as they've all been reserved pretty quickly.
