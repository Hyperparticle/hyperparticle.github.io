After being inundated with [the deep learning hype](https://www.quora.com/Is-deep-learning-overhyped), I've recently taken a journey to learn more deeply about this increasingly popular machine learning technique. Is deep learning just another tech fad, or is there really something there that will form a very important part of our daily lives? AI (and more specifically machine learning) is a field that fascinates me to no end, which is why I am pursuing my higher education in this area. An investigation was in order, so I looked at various online courses and decided to go with Udacity.

[Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) is a 3-6 month, paid online course geared towards individuals who wish to learn and apply the foundations of deep learning: from the underlying linear algebra and derivative calculus it uses, to the high-level CNN, RNN, and GAN architectures. This course is project-driven, and is geared toward individuals who understand the basics of Python who want to show their prospective employers that they can apply fundamental concepts in deep learning to invent and implement artificial neural networks. The program is split into 5 separate projects, and each project contains several video lessons from knowledgeable professionals in the field, along with lots of helpful text explaining everything the individual should know before continuing on. At the end of the lessons, the individual is expected to fill out an iPython notebook to solve a deep learning task. The notebook is then evaluated; if all 5 projects are deemed acceptable, then the individual may graduate from the program. The first project established the underlying mathematical concepts, which culminated in implementing a neural network from scratch with matrices using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). The rest of the projects involved building, training, and evaluating convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models, generative adversarial networks, and much more. These projects all heavily encouraged the use of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), Google's open source machine learning library.

This is my first time paying for an online course, and I am impressed at how well this Udacity course was organized. The videos were on point and explained concepts at a reasonable pace. What I like about this kind of format is that it allows me to learn at a pace that is comfortable for me (I usually like it _fast_. I completed the six month course in one month). I'm also quite inclined to take the Udacity AI Nanodegree course in the near future. I would definitely recommend Udacity for getting into the industry with their portfolio-driven approach. At the end of the program, I got a certificate of completion, continued access to all content, and a guaranteed enrollment slot into one of Udacity's other machine learning Nanodegree courses (e.g., the [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/drive)).

The only downside to a traditional classroom setting is that feedback is not as dynamic. Yes, we do have a Slack channel that have administrators that supply prompt responses, it still not as efficient in answering questions as personal conversation is. As I am a very independent learner who only occasionally needs to ask clarifying questions this does not bother me that much, thankfully.

The entire reason why I chose this course (and went to college) is to make sure I am learning the right concepts, in the right order, and in a manner that I will retain that information. I have found that it can be tremendously difficult for me to motivate myself towards an open-ended goal (e.g., "Let's learn about deep learning."). But provide me a curriculum and a tiny bit of feedback, and it is off to the races. I need _some_ semblance of external motivation, and then I am set. The course was just right for my learning style.
