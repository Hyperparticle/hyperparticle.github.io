title: Drawing 2D Physics Shapes in Unity3D
---

In this tutorial series we will draw and manipulate basic 2D physics shapes using Unity, with no additional external dependencies. Here's a basic prototype you can play.



Back in 2008, I had loads of fun playing [IncrediBots](http://incredibots.com/if/game.php). For the uninitiated, the game is very similar to [Phun (now Algodoo)](http://www.algodoo.com/); it involved drawing basic physics shapes and combining them with fixed, rotating, and sliding joints with motors attached to do interesting things via keyboard input. The game featured several puzzles and a rating system for published contraptions. Here's one such apparatus:



So let's do the same thing in Unity! Conveniently, Unity has excellent support for 2D physics, so implementing a basic prototype is very simple to do.

There are 4 parts:

1. Specifying points with a cursor
1. Rendering 2D shapes
1. Adding 2D physics colliders
1. Toggling 2D physics on and off

This tutorial will implement rectangles, circles, and triangles.
