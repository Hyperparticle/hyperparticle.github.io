  I love a fresh challenge—be it a math problem, a physics puzzle, or machine learning quandary.
</p>

I do machine learning research, write software, and study as a graduate student. I primarily do work in natural language processing and deep learning, but I also like to tinker around with making games in Unity3D. Problem solving is my bread and butter; it gets me up in the morning every day, energized and ready to tackle any challenge hurled my way.

Boise, Idaho in the United States is my hometown. In May 2017, I graduated from [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. A few months later, I started my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics as an Erasmus Mundus student. I study at [Charles University](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/home-page) in Prague, Czech Republic for my first year, and then at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/master/study-programmes/lang-lit/lst/description.html) in Saarbrücken, Germany for my second year. It's been a fantastic experience absorbing the culture and nuances of language in these European cities. [Click here to read a detailed post series on my experiences](/erasmus-mundus).

I like to keep myself occupied with lots of [interesting projects](/projects/). Chief among them is [Hello Augi](https://helloaugi.com/), an ongoing project for a personal assistant that remembers when you forget. Starting in fall 2016, I paired up with a [CS professor at Boise State](https://www.caseyreddkennington.com/) to work on a contextually-aware dialog system with a web UI to help a user retrieve events and people mentioned in the past. This project led to additional research, where I created [Graph NLU](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/graph-nlu), a demonstration of graph databases for natural language understanding.

Other projects include [Nodulus](/nodulus/), an open source puzzle game for mobile, [One Pixel Attack Keras](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/one-pixel-attack-keras), a Keras implementation that demonstrates that convolutional networks can be fooled by changing one pixel in an image, and [LemmaTag](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/LemmaTag), a neural network model that jointly part-of-speech tags and lemmatizes sentences, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in morphologically rich languages (i.e., Czech, German, and Arabic).

Send me a message on [Twitter (@hyperparticle)](https://twitter.com/hyperparticle) and I'll be happy to respond when I have the time.
