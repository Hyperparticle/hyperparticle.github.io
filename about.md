<p class="message">
  I love a fresh challenge—be it a math problem, a physics puzzle, or software architecture quandary.
</p>

Problem solving is my bread and butter; it gets me up in the morning every day, energized and ready to tackle any challenge hurled my way. Although I specialize in AI and machine learning research, I love tinkering with Group Theory and the Unity3D game engine.

I've been a part of a [multitude of software and math projects](/projects/), chief among them is the [Augi](https://helloaugi.com/) personal assistant that remembers when you forget, an open source puzzle game for mobile called [Nodulus](/nodulus/), and [Graph NLU](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/graph-nlu), a dialog system that leverages the power of graph databases.

Boise, Idaho in the United States is my hometown. In May 2017, I graduated from [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. A few months later, I started my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics as an Erasmus Mundus student. I study at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic for my first year, and then at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany  for my second year. It's been a fantastic experience absorbing the culture and nuances of language in these European cities.
