## Final Remarks

 I'm single, without a spouse or kids to take care of, young, and independent. At no other point in my life would I have an opportunity like this, to go and immerse myself in another country, expand my understanding of others' culture, and enjoy the food, sights, and activities Europe has to offer.

The topic, scholarship, and prospect of being immersed in a foreign culture were all motivating factors that led me here to this place at this point in time.

In the end, was it worth it? I think so. It has been such a challenge, but I've lived my life pursuing challenges. I have learned so much being independent in a foreign country.



How time flies: the future is as lofty and distant as a kite, yet as quick as a bullet. Now that my year is up, I'm ready for round two at Saarland University in Germany. More adventure awaits.
