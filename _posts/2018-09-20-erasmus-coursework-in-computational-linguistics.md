## Coursework

Most of the classes for the first semester were compulsory. Data Structures I, Introduction to Complexity and Computability, Statistical Natural Language Processing I, General Linguistics, Natural Language Processing Technologies. I took one elective, Speech Recognition.

Two classes in particular were immensely challenging: Data Structures I and Introduction to Complexity and Computability. They were taught by the same instructor. His favorite word was "trivial". In fact, I tallied up the results at the end of each class, and this instructor has said the word more than 214 times over the course of 14 weeks.

The instructor's grading style was highly unorthodox. If your results were not correct or your implementation had a bug in it, he would mark down your grade as a 0 and have you redo the assignment and resubmit with a 10% penalty.

At the start of the exam period, a group of students attended a meeting with the Vice Dean to discuss many of the issues we've been having in the class. Many expressed concerns that his grading style was unpredictable a .

Exams were even more intense. For Data Structures, I got two questions that amounted to two short sentences that amounted to, "Explain everything you know about this data structure." The resulting explanations took me 3 pages to fill from memory. No notes, just a pencil and paper and everything in your head. It was the hardest exam I've ever taken. All the other classes were a cakewalk in comparison. For the other classes, I studied maybe a day before in preparation, but for Data Structures and C&C, I had to spend two weeks of studying 4-5 hours each day to be comfortable to write out all the class material on a topic from memory.

Unfortunately, the items on the exam were questions that I understood the least.

One saving grace was that after the meeting, the exams were conducted with two instructors present, and they would both conduct the oral evaluation.

There's such a disparity in difficulty among first semester classes. On the one hand we're getting an introduction to Bash scripting, Python, text processing, and on the other hand we're proving the amortized complexity of a Fibonacci Heap using probability theory. The jump in difficulty is massive.

One thing that Charles University does that all other LCT-partnered universities do not is require a state exam at the conclusion of the Master's program. This means that after submitting my thesis, I will be required to go back to Prague to take a final exam on compulsory material that I have studied while at Charles University.
