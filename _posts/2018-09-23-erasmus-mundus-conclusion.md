Upon discovering status as a graduate student in Europe, my friends and family were puzzled as to why I chose to study there. Given my personality and past choices, I can see why. I would think the same thing prior to my final decision to go. I'm a shy introvert who is cautious of trying new things. Living in Europe for two years would be little short of launching myself into outer space... or so I thought.

## Weighing the Options


For my undergraduate studies, I decided to stay with Boise State so I could stay home just a little bit longer. In retrospect, it was a good decision: expenses were low, the computer science program had some excellent classes, and I spent quality time with family. During that time, I acquired a taste for the industry in a year-long internship as a software engineer. This made me shift priorities a bit, convincing myself that graduate studies were unnecessary. But then Dr. Kennington came along, and caused me to desire to push for a degree in an AI-related field. I had wanted to work in AI all along, but did not know how to approach it in the right way.

That is when I decided to reevaluate my options. The LCT program looked interesting, but was it for me? Given strong academic performance, there were plenty of universities in the USA I could try. Most of them would be a short plane ride away. Europe feels like it's on the other side of the solar system. It takes two whole days to complete a trip. I also no longer get access to friends or family. I would be alone in a foreign land studying in an unfamiliar education system.

On the other hand, at no other point in my life would I get to do something quite like this. I would get to explore the refreshing atmosphere of European cities, absorb the culture of the countries of residence, progress my career in a field I am deeply interested in, and then at the end of a couple years obtain two Master's degrees. And the kicker? It's all paid for. Getting married/having kids would limit mobility severely, likely closing that opportunity for good. Getting a Master's or PhD degree elsewhere would disincentivize me, as it would be effectively redundant to get another in Europe. If I get situated with a good industry job, I would then be taking a pay cut.

 Tuition, despite being double for overseas students (8,500 instead of 4,250), is completely covered. I'm grateful for this, as college expenses in the US is notoriously expensive, especially for Master's programs, which can reach as high as $40,000 for University costs alone.

## Final Decisions

I think often what other paths I could have taken, and other decisions I could have executed. In the end, there was no right or wrong answer. I don't know if I made the best choice, and neither do I care.

I am reminded of a quote that touches on this subject:

"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."

<!-- "I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference."

## Final Remarks

 I'm single, without a spouse or kids to take care of, young, and independent. At no other point in my life would I have an opportunity like this, to go and immerse myself in another country, expand my understanding of others' culture, and enjoy the food, sights, and activities Europe has to offer.

The topic, scholarship, and prospect of being immersed in a foreign culture were all motivating factors that led me here to this place at this point in time.

In the end, was it worth it? I think so. It has been such a challenge, but I've lived my life pursuing challenges. I have learned so much being independent in a foreign country.



How time flies: the future is as lofty and distant as a kite, yet as quick as a bullet. Now that my year is up, I'm ready for round two at Saarland University in Germany. More adventure awaits.

## Recommendations

A program in Europe is not for the faint of heart. Be prepared for tough challenges.

If you made it this far, congrats! Now go out there and be the best version of yourself that you aspire to be!
