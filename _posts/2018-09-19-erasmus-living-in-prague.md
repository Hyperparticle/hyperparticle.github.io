## Discovery of Erasmus Mundus

Entering my senior year studying Computer Science (CS) at Boise State, sent out some emails to ask any faculty if they are willing to work with me on a year-long CS project. I caught the attention of [Dr. Casey Kennington](https://coen.boisestate.edu/faculty-staff/caseykennington/), which led us to work on what is now known as a virtual assistant called [Hello Augi](helloaugi.com). Dr. Kennington intrigued me with his deep, internalized knowledge of linguistics and the *many* problems associated with trying to process natural language. Eventually, I found out that he earned three graduate degrees in Europe: two Master's, and one PhD. The idea of having two Master's degrees was bizarre to me, but I eventually got an answer.

Dr. Kennington received a scholarship from the European Commission to study Computational Linguistics at two European partner universities. The [Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Program](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-master-degrees_en) offers joint degrees in several subject areas, one of them being [Language & Communication Technologies (LCT)](https://lct-master.org/). A small handful of EU universities participate in the program, allowing a student to study for a year each at two universities. Upon completion of the two year program, the student receives two computational linguistics degrees, one from each. Competitive applicants are eligible to receive an Erasmus Mundus scholarship, which pays for not only tuition, but also travel and living expenses.

## Preparations for Prague

![Prague Preparations](/public/img/prague-preparations.jpg "Phillip wants to come too")

After compiling the required documents and submitting the LCT application in January 2017, I received a scholarship acceptance notice in April. I chose to study at Charles University in Prague for my first year, as it not only had experienced faculty, but it's also Prague, one of the most breathtaking cities in all of Europe. My second choice for the next year was Saarland University in western Germany, which integrates a large hub of computational researchers into its campus, and is the headquarters for LCT. At that point, I made the decision to push forward with European studies. And that's when the long, arduous process of integrating into the Czech Republic started.

The paperwork and forms required for LCT were not so bad, but the Czech residence permit was something else. First I needed to fill out and sign several forms and get them all notarized (I even needed to get my credit card notarized, to which a bank employee gave me an odd stare), gather photographs and scan documents, and then fly out to the Czech Consulate in Los Angeles to send the application to the Czech Republic. But that was only the beginning. Once in the country, I discovered I had to register with the foreign police a few days after the supposed deadline. The people I met in that office with were highly unprofessional, spoke virtually no English, and made fun of me for being a programmer (Czech is similar enough to Russian that I got the gist of what they were saying). Then nearly 60 days after I submitted my residence application, they were ready for me to finalize the application. I had to wait another two weeks for my appointment with the Ministry of Interior, where I submitted even more paperwork and answered a few basic questions. Finally, I waited another two weeks for one last appointment which handed me my residence permit/visa. Did I mention I had to perform this entire process alone? It was definitely my least favorite part of my experiences in the past year. I felt as though I was drowning in red tape.

## Housing

Upon arriving in Prague, I got situated in an apartment and quickly gained my bearings. I opened a bank account and started receiving scholarship funds within a month. It wasn't a large sum of money, but the living costs were so low that I had more than half left over each month after factoring in rent, transportation, and food. It turns out living in Europe (and especially the Czech Republic) is cheap, aside from buying tech like smartphones.

## Transportation

The transportation system around Prague is quite efficient. The system of metro lines, trams, and busses ensure that you can get anywhere in the city in a short period of time. Tickets are cheap with student discounts, and allow you to board any of the public transportation in Prague. There's even a small boat that can take you from one side of the Vltava river to the other at no cost.

## Weather

![Prague Park](/public/img/prague-park.jpg "Prague in the Fall")

Weather here is fairly calm and predictable. On most days, the sky will be overcast with clouds, and every few days it rains. The four seasons neither get too cold or hot. I'm used to much drier, erratic weather back in Idaho, so this was a welcome change.

## The Computer Science Department at Charles University

What a surprise it was to find out that the Computer Science Department where I would be spending most of my time was not only smack in the heart of Prague's Old Town, but also adjoined with the St. Nicholas Church, a stunning cathedral. The commute from my apartment would take about 35 minutes: first a metro ride to the national theatre, and then a tram ride across the Vltava river to Mal√° Strana.

## Sights and Tours

Many of the museums, theatres, and restaurants offer steep discounts to university students. There was no shortage of fun things to see and do.
