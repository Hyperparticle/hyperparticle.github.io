## Discovery of Erasmus Mundus

Entering my senior year studying Computer Science (CS) at Boise State, sent out some emails to ask any faculty if they are willing to work with me on a year-long CS project. I caught the attention of [Dr. Casey Kennington](https://coen.boisestate.edu/faculty-staff/caseykennington/), which led us to work on what is now known as a virtual assistant called [Hello Augi](helloaugi.com). Dr. Kennington intrigued me with his deep, internalized knowledge of linguistics and the *many* problems associated with trying to process natural language. Eventually, I found out that he earned three graduate degrees in Europe: two Master's, and one PhD.

The idea of having two Master's degrees was bizarre to me, but I eventually got an answer. Dr. Kennington received a scholarship from the European Commission to study Computational Linguistics at two European partner universities. The [Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Program](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-master-degrees_en) offers joint degrees in several subject areas, one of them being [Language & Communication Technologies (LCT)](https://lct-master.org/). A small handful of EU universities participate in the program, allowing a student to study for a year each at two universities. Upon completion of the two year program, the student receives two computational linguistics degrees, one from each. Competitive applicants are eligible to receive an Erasmus Mundus scholarship, which pays for not only tuition, but also travel and living expenses.

## Preparations for Prague

After compiling the required documents and submitting the LCT application in January 2017, I received a scholarship acceptance notice in April.

In addition, I received a scholarship which is essentially providing me a free education for my entire study period. I have more than enough funds for tuition, housing, living expenses, transportation, food, and basically anything else I need to live comfortably. It turns out living in Europe is cheap (aside from buying tech).

But many events have transpired since then.

Well, I've made it to the Czech Republic.

It took a couple days for the jet lag to wear off. A 7.5 hour flight is not a comfortable one.

On my third day in Prague I registered with the foreign police. The people I met with were highly unprofessional.

## Transportation in Prague

The transportation system around Prague is pretty great. The system of metro lines, trams, and busses ensure that you can get anywhere in the city in a short period of time. Tickets are quite cheap, and allow you to board any of the transportation in Prague. There's even a small boat that can take you from one side of the Vltava river to the other.

## Weather

Weather here is fairly calm and predictable. On most days, the sky will be overcast with clouds. Every few days it rains

I'm used to much drier, erratic weather back in Idaho. 

## Sights and Tours

Student discounts.

## Housing

Instead of going with the dorms, I've decided to stay at an apartment.

## Bureaucracy

Something tells me this process should have been easier, but it wasn't.
