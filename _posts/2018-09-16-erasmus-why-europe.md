Upon discovering status as a graduate student in Europe, my friends and family were puzzled as to why I chose to study there. Given my personality and past choices, I can see why. I would think the same thing prior to my final decision to go. I'm a shy introvert who is cautious of trying new things. Living in Europe for two years would be little short of launching myself into outer space... or so I thought.

## Discovery of Erasmus Mundus

Europe is an interesting place. Due to its unique geography and rich cultural history, it is densely packed with old cities (some ancient, even).

Exploring Europe, two Master's degrees, artificial intelligence, scholarship. At no other point in my life would I get the same opportunity. Having my own family to take care of would be exponentially harder.

But the idea of exploring Europe, receiving two graduate degrees in two years, and potentially having it all paid for by a scholarship (tuition, travel, living expenses) from the European Commission was too enticing to pass up.

Shops, museums, cathedrals, and theaters were abundant. Transportation was efficient.

### Some Doubts

For my undergraduate studies, I decided to stay with Boise State University so I could stay home with family just a little bit longer. In retrospect, it was a good decision: expenses were low, the computer science program had some excellent classes, and I spent quality time with family. During that time, I acquired a taste for the industry in a year-long internship as a software engineer.

Given my academic achievements, there were plenty of excellent universities in the USA I could go to. I would not have a problem getting into a great west coast university where I could quickly travel to visit family. Europe feels like it's on the other side of the solar system. It takes two whole days just to fly there. I no longer get access to friends or family. I'm alone in a foreign land studying in a very different education system.

### Final Decisions



But beyond these benefits, I know I could have received similar experiences at other universities in the USA as well. I think often what other paths I could have taken, and other decisions I could have executed. But this does not matter too much. I am reminded of a quote that touches on this subject:

"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."
