Upon discovering status as a graduate student in Europe, my friends and family were puzzled as to why I chose to study there. Given my personality and past choices, I can see why. I would think the same thing prior to my final decision to go. I'm a shy introvert who is cautious of trying new things. Living in Europe for two years would be little short of launching myself into outer space... or so I thought.

## Discovery of Erasmus Mundus

![Prague Park](/public/img/prague-park.jpg "Prague in the Fall")

Entering my senior year studying Computer Science (CS) at Boise State, sent out some emails to ask any faculty if they are willing to work with me on a year-long CS project. I caught the attention of [Dr. Casey Kennington](https://coen.boisestate.edu/faculty-staff/caseykennington/), which led us to work on what is now known as a virtual assistant called [Hello Augi](helloaugi.com). Dr. Kennington intrigued me with his deep, internalized knowledge of linguistics and the *many* problems associated with trying to process natural language. Eventually, I found out that he earned three graduate degrees in Europe: two Master's, and one PhD.

The idea of having two Master's degrees was bizarre to me, but I eventually got an answer. Dr. Kennington received a scholarship from the European Commission to study Computational Linguistics at two European partner universities. The [Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Program](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-master-degrees_en) offers joint degrees in several subject areas, one of them being [Language & Communication Technologies (LCT)](https://lct-master.org/). A small handful of EU universities participate in the program, allowing a student to study for a year each at two universities. Upon completion of the two year program, the student receives two computational linguistics degrees, one from each. Competitive applicants are eligible to receive an Erasmus Mundus scholarship, which pays for not only tuition, but also travel and living expenses.

## Weighing the Options

For my undergraduate studies, I decided to stay with Boise State so I could stay home just a little bit longer. In retrospect, it was a good decision: expenses were low, the computer science program had some excellent classes, and I spent quality time with family. During that time, I acquired a taste for the industry in a year-long internship as a software engineer. This made me shift priorities a bit, convincing myself that graduate studies were unnecessary. But then Dr. Kennington came along, and caused me to desire to push for a degree in an AI-related field. I had wanted to work in AI all along, but did not know how to approach it in the right way.

That is when I decided to reevaluate my options. The LCT program looked interesting, but was it for me? Given strong academic performance, there were plenty of universities in the USA I could try. Most of them would be a short plane ride away. Europe feels like it's on the other side of the solar system. It takes two whole days to complete a trip. I also no longer get access to friends or family. I would be alone in a foreign land studying in an unfamiliar education system.

On the other hand, at no other point in my life would I get to do something quite like this. I would get to explore the refreshing atmosphere of European cities, absorb the culture of the countries of residence, progress my career in a field I am deeply interested in, and then at the end of a couple years obtain two Master's degrees. And the kicker? It's all paid for. Getting married/having kids would limit mobility severely, likely closing that opportunity for good. Getting a Master's or PhD degree elsewhere would disincentivize me, as it would be effectively redundant to get another in Europe. If I get situated with a good industry job, I would then be taking a pay cut.

## Final Decisions

I think often what other paths I could have taken, and other decisions I could have executed. In the end, there was no right or wrong answer. I don't know if I made the best choice, and neither do I care.

I am reminded of a quote that touches on this subject:

"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."

Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference."
