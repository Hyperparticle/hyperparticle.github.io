Now what's the point of going to Europe without exploring a bit? Here is a compilation of media artifacts in my favorite cities.

## Prague

Here's another view of Prague from the [Petřín Lookout Tower](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/116/petrin-lookout-tower-petrinska-rozhledna). Feel free to shift+click the image below to get a sense of scale.

The [Prague gardens below the castle](https://www.palacove-zahrady.cz/en) offer an exquisite view, both inside and outside.

Street performers like to flock onto [Charles Bridge](http://www.myczechrepublic.com/prague/sightseeing/charles_bridge.html), Prague's most famous landmark.

Statues and art installations pepper the city. Franz Kafka, a famous writer born in Prague, is a long-time favorite.

## Karlovy Vary

West of Prague is a famous spa town named [Karlovy Vary](https://www.karlovyvary.cz/en), in which so many Russians vacation there that their employees speak in Russian before falling back to Czech. The town is built on top of a hot springs and features a dense forest of colorful trees in the fall.

One can also take a gondola up a large hill to find a tower that overlooks the city.

The town is most beautiful in the fall when the leaves are changing hues.

## Vienna

## Munich

 The animated image you saw at the top of this page was taken as a series of ~150 photographs stitched together and stabilized in After Effects to create a hyperlapse. Note how the clock ticks, showing that the pictures were taken over the course of 10-15 minutes.

## Saarbrucken

## Nancy

Now it's time to close this post with some additional remarks and personal thoughts on the subject of studying in Europe.
